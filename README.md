## How to use
- pip3 install -r requirements.txt
- python setup.py build
- ./build/[system]/start

## Other way.

You can use the program also by just opening the 'start.py', 'setup.py' only makes a executable for your system OS so you can use the program without having to need to have python on your computer.
